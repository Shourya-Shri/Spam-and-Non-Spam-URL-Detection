# Spam-and-Non-Spam-URL-Detection

Welcome to the URL Threat Detection repository, where cutting-edge machine learning meets web security! üõ°Ô∏è

üöÄ Project Overview
Embark on a journey into the world of web security with our URL Threat Detection project. In today's digital landscape, where cyber threats loom large, our advanced machine learning model stands as a guardian against malicious URLs. This project is designed to swiftly identify and classify URLs into different threat categories, including phishing, malware, defacement, and benign.

üîç Key Features:-

1. Data Exploration and Visualization:

(a) Unleash the power of data visualization with word cloud representations for phishing, malware, defacement, and benign URLs.
(b) Gain insights into URL features, including the use of IP addresses, abnormal URLs, and Google indexing.

2. Feature Engineering:

(a) Extract comprehensive features from URLs, unraveling counts of characters, symbols, and specific keywords.
(b) Dive into URL metrics such as length, hostname length, and other crucial indicators.

3. Machine Learning Models:

(a) Harness the potential of Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM classifiers.
(b) Evaluate model performance through detailed classification reports, confusion matrices, and insightful feature importance plots.

4. Prediction Functionality:

(a) Empower your applications with the get_prediction_from_url function, predicting the threat category for a given URL.
